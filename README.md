# Setup cloud centric Org from scratch with SOC

## Introduction

This cybersecurity portfolio project details the comprehensive design and deployment of a cloud-centric enterprise organization integrated with Security Operations Center (SOC) capabilities. Structured through progressive implementation phases, the project demonstrates real-world hands-on expertise in building secure cloud environments, leveraging platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Entra ID, Intune, Cloudflare, Sentinel, Defender, and Terraform. Each phase includes technical steps, evidence, and skill validation—covering domain management, identity and device provisioning, zero trust architecture, licensing automation, advanced threat protection, and SIEM/SOAR deployment. The portfolio showcases both technical deliverables and business outcomes, such as enhanced security posture, operational efficiency, compliance readiness, scalability, and cost optimization. Future enhancements focus on deeper cloud integrations, advanced threat analytics, automated security orchestration, and multi-cloud strategies, positioning this project as a model for modern enterprise cybersecurity transformation.
